# Identifying wild mushrooms: what to eat, what to avoid? 

Through classification modeling, this project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous. 

The raw dataset utilized in this project was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The dataset includes characteristics on 8,124 mushroom samples from 23 species of gilled mushrooms.

The target variable assessed was a class distinction of 'edible' or 'poisonous'. The explanatory variables covered a range of descriptive and visual characteristics on the structure of each observed mushroom - such as, cap color, odor,ring number and stalk shape.
